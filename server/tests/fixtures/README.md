# Test Fixtures

This directory contains test files used in the anything-llm test suite.

## Files

- `test.pdf`: A simple PDF file used for testing the text extraction service
- Add more test files here as needed

## Guidelines

1. Keep test files small and focused
2. Include different types of content (text, tables, images) for thorough testing
3. Document any special characteristics of test files in this README
4. Use realistic but non-sensitive data
