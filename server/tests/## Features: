## Features:
- No Cloud/external dependencies all you need: PyTorch based OCR (EasyOCR) + Ollama are shipped and configured via docker-compose no data is sent outside your dev/server environment,
- PDF/Office to Markdown conversion with very high accuracy using different OCR strategies including llama3.2-vision, easyOCR, minicpm-v, remote URL strategies including [marker-pdf](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker)
- PDF/Office to JSON conversion using Ollama supported models (eg. LLama 3.1)
- LLM Improving OCR results LLama is pretty good with fixing spelling and text issues in the OCR text
- Removing PII This tool can be used for removing Personally Identifiable Information out of document - see examples
- Distributed queue processing using [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html)
- Caching using Redis - the OCR results can be easily cached prior to LLM processing,
- Storage Strategies switchable storage strategies (Google Drive, Local File System ...)
- CLI tool for sending tasks and processing results

## Getting started
You might want to run the app directly on your machine for development purposes OR to use for example Apple GPUs (which are not supported by Docker at the moment).
